    2. Factories
       -> Abstract
       -> Factories

2. Structural patterns :- focus on using inheritance to compose interfaces and define objects in a way to create new functionality.
   
3. behavioural :- focus on how to communicate between objects.

     singleton :  enforces the existence of only one object of the class being created. means we can store all our configuration values at exactly one place.
